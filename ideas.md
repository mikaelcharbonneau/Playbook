  **Design Movement**: Neumorphism (Soft UI) + Glassmorphism Hybrid
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Tactile Softness**: Elements should feel like they are extruded from the background or floating softly above it.
  2. **Light & Air**: The interface should feel weightless, using light to define hierarchy rather than heavy borders.
  3. **Playful Geometry**: Use exaggerated rounded corners (super-ellipses) to make the interface feel friendly and approachable for learning.
  4. **Focus through Depth**: Use elevation changes to guide the user's attention to the active game or task.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  The requested #B6EBE7 (Minty Fresh) is the star. It represents clarity, growth, and calmness—perfect for learning.
  - Background: A very pale, warm off-white (Cream/Bone) to reduce eye strain compared to stark white.
  - Surface: Pure white with high transparency (glass) for overlays.
  - Accent: #B6EBE7 for primary actions, but used as a glowing light source rather than just a flat fill.
  - Text: Dark charcoal (#2D3748) instead of pure black for a softer contrast.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Floating Islands**: Instead of a rigid grid, content floats in "islands" or "bubbles" that drift vertically.
  - **Overlap & Layering**: Cards slightly overlap to show continuity in the feed.
  - **Bottom-Heavy Navigation**: All controls are within thumb reach, floating in a glass pill at the bottom.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **"Gummy" Buttons**: Buttons that look squishy and pressable with inner shadows and highlights.
  2. **Frosted Glass Cards**: Game cards have a frosted glass effect at the bottom to overlay text on images.
  3. **Soft Glows**: Active states emit a soft minty glow (#B6EBE7) instead of a hard outline.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Physics-Based**: Scrolling has momentum; cards bounce slightly when they hit the edge.
  - **Haptic Visuals**: Tapping a button visually depresses it into the screen.
  - **Swipe-Driven**: Everything is dismissible or navigable via swipes.

  **Animation**:
  - **Springs**: All movements use spring physics (bouncy, organic) rather than linear eases.
  - **Morphing**: The "Create" button morphs into the chat interface.
  - **Parallax**: Background elements move slower than foreground cards to create depth.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: "Nunito" or "Quicksand" (Rounded Sans) – Friendly, approachable, matches the rounded UI.
  - **Body**: "Mulish" or "DM Sans" – Clean, legible, but with character.
  - **Hierarchy**: Large, bold titles; small, uppercase, tracked-out labels for metadata (TOPIC, LEVEL).

  **Design Movement**: Bauhaus / Swiss Style Modernism (Digital Adaptation)
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Radical Simplicity**: Form follows function. No decoration for decoration's sake.
  2. **Grid & Asymmetry**: Strong alignment but unexpected placements to keep it dynamic.
  3. **Bold Contrast**: High contrast between the soft background and the bold, geometric elements.
  4. **Typography as Image**: Type is the main visual element, treated as art.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - Background: Pale Beige / Eggshell.
  - Accent: #B6EBE7 used as a "highlighter" marker effect behind text or as geometric shapes.
  - Secondary Accents: Muted primary colors (Mustard Yellow, Terracotta) for categories, keeping the palette earthy but fun.
  - Text: Stark Black for maximum impact.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Blocks**: The feed isn't just cards; it's a stack of modular blocks of varying heights.
  - **Split Screen**: The "Create" page splits the screen geometrically between input and preview.
  - **Typographic Scale**: Massive headings that bleed off the edge or take up 50% of the card.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Geometric Shapes**: Circles, triangles, and squares used as background patterns or icons.
  2. **Thick Strokes**: Icons and dividers use consistent, thick monoline strokes.
  3. **Underline Highlights**: Thick, mint-colored underlines for emphasis.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap & Slide**: Interactions are precise and snappy, not floaty.
  - **Reveal**: Tapping a card "unfolds" it to reveal details.
  - **Direct Manipulation**: Dragging elements feels like moving physical paper blocks.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slide & Reveal**: Elements slide in from the sides or reveal from behind masks.
  - **Staggered Entrance**: Text lines animate in one by one.
  - **Geometric Morphs**: A circle button expands into a square modal.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: "Syne" or "Clash Display" – Unique, artful, attention-grabbing.
  - **Body**: "Space Grotesk" or "Inter" – Technical, clean, readable.
  - **Hierarchy**: Size is the primary differentiator.

  **Design Movement**: Gen Z "Chaos" Maximalism (Toned Down for Learning)
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Unapologetic Boldness**: Big elements, loud patterns, breaking the grid intentionally.
  2. **Raw & Authentic**: Less polish, more "sticker" aesthetic.
  3. **Collage Feel**: Elements look like they are pasted onto the screen.
  4. **Hyper-Expressive**: Emojis, scribbles, and doodles are part of the UI.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - Background: White paper texture.
  - Accent: #B6EBE7 is used for "tape" effects or background blobs.
  - Palette: Neon pops against the pastel background.
  - Text: Dark Blue or Purple instead of black for a digital-native vibe.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Scrapbook**: The feed looks like a vertical scrapbook.
  - **Tilt & Rotate**: Cards are slightly tilted (random rotation -1deg to 1deg) to feel organic.
  - **Sticker Overlay**: UI controls look like stickers placed on top of content.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Doodles**: Hand-drawn arrows and circles to highlight learning points.
  2. **Sticker Buttons**: Buttons look like die-cut stickers.
  3. **Marquee Text**: Scrolling text for trending topics.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Playful**: Buttons squish and wobble when pressed.
  - **Drag & Drop**: Users can drag stickers or answers.
  - **Instant Feedback**: Confetti or doodle explosions on correct answers.

  **Animation**:
  - **Wiggle**: Elements have a subtle idle wiggle.
  - **Pop**: Modals pop open with an elastic overshoot.
  - **Frame-by-Frame**: Animations look like stop-motion (12fps).

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: "Dela Gothic One" or "Pangolin" – Chunky, handwritten feel.
  - **Body**: "Comic Neue" or "Fredoka" – Readable but friendly.
  - **Hierarchy**: Mixed fonts in the same sentence for emphasis.
